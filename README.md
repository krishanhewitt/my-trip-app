# RememberMyTrip - App

This is a side project I develop in my spare time. The goal of this web app is to backup and display details from trips/vacations to make it easier to remember your experiences later on.

## Tech Stack

I wanted to maintain and improve my full-stack abilities so I chose to use modern web developlment technologies. Below is a list of the core frameworks and libraries used for the front-end of this app.

* React.js
* react-router-dom
* jsonwebtoken
* bcrypt
* yup
* TailwindCSS

### Deployment

Currently this app has only been built locally. I have plans to release it via Heroku or perhaps a Digital Ocean droplet but haven't got it to a state where I'd like to deploy it yet.

### Future Plans

Once the app has a stable release; some features I'm interested in adding are:

* Food Journal (with photo support)
* Yearly/Random reminders from a trip
* Trip Budget (daily expense, trip estimate, trip total)
* Google Maps integration
* PWA Release
